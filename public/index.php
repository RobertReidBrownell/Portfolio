<h2>Why am I a good fit for your project or team?</h2>

<p>I am great for your project because I have a very dogged and relentless approach when I have set my mind to completing a
task. When I was building my first from scratch website I explained my vision for a specific look of the menu to the
client. They very much liked the idea and signed off on the design as a whole and work began. Well like often happens
(to me at least) I had said I could do something that required a different skill set than I had up to that point.
Instead of going back to the client and telling them I didn’t know how to do the menu, I did hours and hours of research
and testing to learn how to do it. In the end I ended up using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to help generate
the necessary menu effects and as a result both myself and the client are very happy with the results. See what you think

<p>I would be a great fit for your team because I work well with others. Whether that is in an advisory role when a peer
has come to me with a problem and wants my help solving it or suggesting possible solutions, in a group role where we
are collaborating in or order to create or refine a project, or even in an employee role given tasks to complete and
deadlines to meet. In fact, I was voted as the MVP (Most Valuable Peer) by my peers because I try to be available and
willing to help anytime someone needs it. You don’t have to take my word for it, take a look at some of the things my
peers and Instructor have said about me.</p>


<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>I am just your regular neighborhood "adult" (the quotes are because my wife constantly tells me that I shouldn't be
allowed to call myself that) trying to follow his dreams and carve out a spot in this ever-changing landscape we call
web development. I realized that I was interested in web development as a career when I was tasked with building a
website for a previous employer. I searched high and low and couldn't find a theme on Wordpress that was exactly what
they or I wanted. So I found one that sufficed and I started the biggest learning experience of my life thus far. I knew
how I wanted certain things to behave (or not behave, STOP MOVING MY CONTENT) but I didn't know yet how to do it. Over
the next couple months of putting this website together and learning the HTML and CSS I needed to make it look good and
function how I wanted it to, I came to the realization that I enjoy this. I enjoy creating something and trying to get
it just right both in the look and how it functions. I enjoy the challenge of an ever changing and evolving field and I
can't wait to dive head first into your project so we can let my passion and outside of the box thinking work for you.</p>





<p>What do I enjoy doing when I am not stuck behind a keyboard you ask? Well I actually really enjoy video games (Destiny
is my current game of choice), disc golf, and I also really enjoy playing boards games in my free time. That being said,
even in my spare time I end up thinking about ways to implement online technologies. I am currently working on learning
a couple specific technologies so that I can help contribute to an online collaboration to create a user dashboard for
    Destiny players.</p>
